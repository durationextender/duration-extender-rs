# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2024-10-19

### Breaking Changes

- **BREAKING**: Integer overflow during duration creation now **panics** for all types instead of silently saturating.
  - Previously: Large values (e.g., `u64::MAX.minutes()`) would saturate to `u64::MAX` seconds.
  - Now: Panics with descriptive error messages like:
    `"duration value 3074457345618258602 minutes overflows u64 seconds capacity"`.
  - Signed integers (`i32`, `i64`) continue to **panic on negative values**.
  - Aligns with Rustâ€™s philosophy of explicit failure on invalid input.

### Why this change?

Previously, overflow was silently handled, which could hide bugs. Panicking makes failures explicit and safer for production code.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-10-20

### Breaking Changes

- **BREAKING**: Negative values for `i32` and `i64` now panic with clear error messages instead of silently using absolute value.
  - Previously: `(-5).minutes()` would equal `5.minutes()` (surprising!)
  - Now: `(-5).minutes()` panics with "duration cannot be negative: got -5 minutes".

- **BREAKING**: Integer overflow during duration creation **panics** instead of silently saturating.
  - Previously: Large values (e.g., `u64::MAX.minutes()`) would saturate.
  - Now: Panics with descriptive message.

### Why this change?

Panicking on negative and overflow values prevents silent bugs and ensures explicit, safe behavior.
